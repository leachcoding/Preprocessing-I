        <p>Hi, I love to hike, lift weights, read, and explore new cities. I currently am enrolled at Lambda School, in the Full Stack Web Development Track, which is an in-depth program that teaches you the foundations of web development and computer science. I am skilled in HTML, CSS, Flexbox, CSS Grid, Bootstrap, and Javascript. I am improving on my jQuery, Git, the DOM, and Python. I am currently starting to learn LESS, Node, Yarn, React, Redux, NodeJs, Web API's, ExpressJs, OOP, Algorithms and Data Structures, C#, Hash Tables, Computer Architecture, and Web Servers. If there is any new technology out there, I atleast want to give it a cursory look, as I'm a glutton for learning and improving myself, whether its the body or the mind.</p>
